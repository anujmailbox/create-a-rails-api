# [Create a Rails API][published url]
## Instructor: [José Mota][instructor url]


Since it's release many years ago, Ruby on Rails has become a staple of the web development industry. Today however, web architectures tend to favour the integration of separate services, or front-end code connecting to the back-end through JSON APIs. 

Rails hasn't always had strong support for API development. However, community-built gems have filled the gap and Rails is now an excellent choice for developing a server-side API. In this course, Envato Tuts+ instructor José Mota will show you how to get started with API development in Ruby on Rails to deliver data through JSON.
